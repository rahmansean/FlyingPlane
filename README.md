# FlyingPlane
A web-based 3D interactive game made using Javascript, Three.js, HTML, and CSS in the VScode environment. The idea behind this is to operate a plane, flying it endlessly through the sky while avoiding collisions with particles coming its way. Upon collision with the enemy stone, the plane loses health, eventually losing life.
